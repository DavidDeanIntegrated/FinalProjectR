This package marks the culmination of my final semester in the Masters of Medical , Molecular Medicine program at USF. I took the Introduction to R Programming course because I think that knowing computer coding languages is going to be an increasingly valuable skill in the 21st century. I am happy that this course was not limited to biomedical studies, though I now feel prepared to take a computer programming class that directly applies programming to biomedical studies. 



## Final Project Package Features

My goal for this project was to create a fun, user-friendly package of R code that allowed one to search for information about specific guests in a book by Tim Ferris titled, "Tools of Titans." Tim Ferris is known for interviewing world-class performers in many domains. The 112 person guest list from Tools of Titans is divided into 3 main categories: Healthy (1), Wealthy (2), and Wise (3).I've included a quote from each guest that appears in this book by Tim Ferris as well as their Twitter handle and the number of Twitter followers each guest has as of this publishing. This package takes advantage of subset and gripl functions to organize the data set. 

## Datasets and Variables

IMPORTANT NOTE#1: The package is dependent on the dataset included in github repository.Object definitions are listed in sourcefile1.
