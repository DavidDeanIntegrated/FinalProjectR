Description: This package sorts a dataset containing the extensive guest list of 
    Tim Ferris' book "Tools of Titans." The guest list is divided into 3 main categories: 
    Healthy (1), Wealthy (2), and Wise (3). This package allows one to more easily browse 
    through the 112 different guests in a variety of different groupings. One can search 
    the last name of one of the guests, and that guest's information will appear
    including a quote from their interview with Tim Ferris.
